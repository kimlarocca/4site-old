                  Selling</b></font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font size="2">(ARA) - From home makeover
                      shows to Do-It-Yourself stores and countless design and
                      remodeling magazines, Americans are equipped with the latest
                      information and trends in home improvement. While these
                      resources provide valuable advice when remodeling your
                      house, homeowners should be just as knowledgeable about
                      their options when buying and selling a home.</font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There
                      are a number of variables to consider when putting your
                      house on the market or purchasing a new home. For consumers,
                      there are several tools to help you make the right decision.
                      Equifax Home Valuator is a tool designed to give consumers
                      easy access to information such as high and low property
                      value ranges, neighborhood comparables and property record
                      information, when available. <br>
                            <br>
  You may think that overpricing and letting interested buyers make an offer
  is an effective strategy, but this approach can backfire. If the home is overpriced,
  potential buyers looking in a lower price range may never see it. Furthermore,
  stagnant houses in the market take much longer to sell. On the other hand,
  when purchasing a new home, how do you know if you're getting a good deal?
  Is it a bargain? Is the home over-priced for the neighborhood? <br>
  <br>
  Knowing the factors that can impact the buying and selling process and understanding
  the value of your home can eliminate any guesswork and help you negotiate an
  optimal price. <br>
  <br>
  Here are a few tips to consider when you are ready to buy or sell. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">                  <b>* Be prepared for your purchase.</b> <br>
                    <br>
  Spend time analyzing your budget and finances to determine how much home you
  can comfortably afford. Once you've made your decision, try to be conservative
  with your spending a few months before entering into the home buying or selling
  process to accommodate unexpected initial expenses. Also, be mindful of your
  credit score. Make a conscious effort to monitor it and take the appropriate
  steps improve it, if necessary, in order to take full advantage of better interest
  rates afforded to those with good credit. <br>
    <br>
    <b>* Research your agent. </b><br>
    <br>
  The relationship between a home buyer/seller and a real estate agent requires
  the same give and take as needed in a marriage. To succeed, the relationship
  must be based on trust and an understanding of mutual goals. Before you hire
  an agent, home buyers and sellers should learn as much as possible about the
  process. For example, asking the right questions can help ensure that the agent
  is familiar with the target area. It's also helpful to confirm the agent's
  average sales volume and whether they typically work with buyers or sellers.
  Taking the time to do your research can save you money down the road. <br>
    <br>
    <b>* Use your head, not your heart. </b><br>
    <br>
  Whether buying or selling, don't let emotions cloud your judgment. Assess any
  emotional ties you might have to a current or prospective home and ensure that
  personal feelings are not guiding your decisions. For example, even if you've
  found your dream home, does it suit your needs, can you afford it, and is it
  worth the asking price? <br>
    <br>
    <b>* Be precise.</b> <br>
    <br>
  Whether you're a first-time home buyer or a seasoned home owner, you can strengthen
  your negotiating power with an accurate and unbiased assessment of your home's
  value. Tools such as Equifax Home Valuator can improve your knowledge when
  negotiating an optimal buying or selling price. Using comprehensive automated
  valuation models, Home Valuator provides the high and low value of your current
  or potential home based on comparable residences sold in the neighborhood. <br>
