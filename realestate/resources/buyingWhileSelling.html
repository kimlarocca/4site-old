                    Buying a new home is often one of the most exhilarating
                    events a family experiences. But this excitement can be
                    replaced by anxiety for buyers who are selling a home at
                    the same time. </p>
                  <table width="100%"  border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

                          <p> Buyers who are purchasing a new home while selling their old one try to close
                            on both properties at the same time to ensure a smooth move. Although all parties
                            may have the best of intentions, the properties may not close concurrently. Buyers
                            fear the idea of paying for two mortgages at the same time, or moving the family
                            after school starts. </p>

                  <p align="justify" class="style5">"Many borrowers do not think of buying and selling a home as one full transaction,
                    and therefore, they tend to think of the "buy" and then they are chasing the "sell" transaction," says
                    Tony Meola, executive vice president of home loans production for Washington
                    Mutual. "We recommend several strategies to people who are buying and selling
                    a home at the same time. If a buyer plans properly, he or she should be able
                    to ease out of the old home and into the new one without too much difficulty." <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Selling Strategies</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Meola said that people should first find a qualified real estate agent and
                    a mortgage expert. <br>
                    <br>
"A mortgage loan consultant from Washington Mutual will pre-approve prospective
                    buyers for you. As a seller, you should negotiate only with buyers who are pre-approved
                    to purchase your house," says Meola. "And, have the loan consultant pre-approve
                    you. As a buyer, you want to know how much house you can afford, so you can present
                    yourself to sellers as a qualified buyer to purchase the house you want." <br>
                    <br>
                    Meola also says that it's important to allow extra time in the home buying
                    and selling schedule if you are buying and selling at the same time. "This
                    advice seems obvious, but list your house for sale long before you plan on
                    buying, if possible. When you get an offer, negotiate the escrow period to
                    accommodate your purchasing needs," says Meola. "If that's not possible, ask
                    to rent your old house if you haven't closed on your new one -- then you won't
                    have to move twice." <br>
                    <br>
                    Sellers may be able to mitigate their concerns by accepting a lower offer
                    that allows more flexibility on the closing date. "For example, if the high bidder
                    has to sell his or her house first, you might be better off selling to a first-time
                    homebuyer," Meola points out. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Buying Strategies</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are planning to buy in a competitive market, you may need to make
                    your purchase before selling your current home. In this case, buyers can
                    borrow a down payment until their existing home sells. This is called "bridge financing." There
                    are also common and necessary contingencies that should be included in a purchase
                    offer. <br>
                    <br>
"For example, consider adding a clause stating that your offer is contingent
                    upon the successful sale of the property you currently own," says Meola. This
                    contingency prevents the buyer from forfeiting their earnest money deposit, or
                    making two mortgage payments at once. <br>
                    <br>
"In some competitive markets, buyers make contingency-free offers in order to
                    be more attractive to sellers," says Meola. "Anyone using this strategy should
                    plan to obtain interim financing. We advise doing this even if the former home
                    is sold, but not yet closed. If you make a non-contingent offer and the sale
                    of your existing home falls out of escrow, you could lose the deposit you placed
                    on the new home." <br>
