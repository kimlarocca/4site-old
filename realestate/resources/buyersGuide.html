                                you should do when shopping for a home is become
                                pre-qualified, or better yet, pre-approved, for
                                a loan. The process is typically free and involves
                                filling out a short application. To expedite
                                the process, many lenders allow this application
                                to be submitted over the phone or even on-line!</font></p>
                            <p align="justify"><font size="2">The lender will
                                use the information you submit to determine how
                                much you are able to borrow. This information
                                is very helpful because you will know what homes
                                you can afford and you won&#8217;t waste time
                                looking at homes you can&#8217;t afford.</font></p>
                            <p align="justify"><font size="2">In addition, the
                                lender will provide you with a pre-approval letter
                                upon acceptance of your application. This letter
                                will show the seller that you are able to purchase
                                their property and you are not simply wasting
                                their time. Many sellers will not enter negotiations
                                without a pre-approval letter, so be sure you
                                do not skip this step!</font></p></td>
