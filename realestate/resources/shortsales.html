2. If you qualify, the property is listed and placed on the market for sale. Many factors go into the proper pricing and marketing of your home for maximum exposure. &nbsp;Time is not on your side, so it's important to get your property sold quickly.<BR>
<BR>
3. All the necessary forms and documents are prepared and gathered. The Hardship Package can make or break a Short Sale. &nbsp;It must be complete and convey a viable financial argument as to why the lender(s) should accept less than what is owed on the loan(s).<BR>
<BR>
4. Once an offer is received and accepted by the sellers, it's submitted to the lender(s), along with the Hardship Package, for approval. <BR>
<BR>
5. Upon approval, and the receipt of the acceptance letter, the file moves to closing.<BR>

                            <p class="style1">A. Lender(s) typically prefer to work with a REALTOR&reg; as opposed to working directly with the buyers. &nbsp;Getting a Short Sale approved by the existing lender(s) is a very complicated, multi-step process. &nbsp;This requires a high level of patience, persistence and, most importantly, experience. &nbsp;The lender(s) realizes that it is in their best interest, as well as that of the borrower, to the have the Short Sale file packaged properly from the very beginning, by a real estate professional that does not have a conflict of interest.<BR>
                              <BR>
B. <strong>PROTECT</strong> your personal information, that's why you do NOT want the buyers working directly with the lender(s). &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;In order to get a Short Sale approved you must provide the lender(s) with a great deal of personal financial information and documentation. &nbsp;Do you want the buyers to have access to all this personal information? <BR>
<BR>
C. The buyers are concerned with closing the deal in accordance with their best interests, NOT yours! You need a professional that is committed to representing your best interests.<BR>
<BR>
D. You get Professional Representation, at <strong>NO COST TO YOU</strong> - &nbsp;The lender(s) pays the real estate commission, so professional representation is free to you. &nbsp;In essence, the lender(s) pays the real estate fees, along with most other sales costs, so that the Short Sale file can be handled by a professional.<BR>
<BR>
If you decide that a Short Sale is the best option for you, make sure that a highly qualified Real Estate Professional, such as myself, is representing you. </p>
